# Trash Classification
In this project, I aim to classify trash images into six distinct categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trash images, and its performance is tracked and evaluated using the Weights & Biases (wandb) experiment tracking tool.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is **TrashNet**, a labeled collection of images of different types of trash. I load this dataset using the [Hugging Face Datasets library](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- [Hugging Face Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets), TensorFlow, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dk1781/trash_classification.git
cd trash_classification
```

2. Run the notebook
```

## Pre-trained Models
The pre-trained models are available to use on the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/dk178/Trash_classification)
